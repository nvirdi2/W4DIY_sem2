Reflection
  These two assignments was honeslty pretty hard but I feel like that it was not as hard 
as hard compared to the last workshop. There was many reasons why I felt like this
workshop was a little easier than the other. When looking at workshop 3 I said it was
the "hardest one I have done so far" and I still stand by that. This workshop was
focused on constructors and destructors. My plan for this one was to create one file at 
a time because I know the last one was hard because I did it very messy and did all the 
header files and then the modules. This helped organize the process. According to the 
learning outcomes I learned how to define a default constructor which was honestly very 
easy. I learned that a default constructor has no parameters or are all "default" 
parameters. Custom constructor was actually very easy too but when looking at the name 
it seemed very hard. However, the most helpful i believe that i learned was the defining 
a destructor to make sure that any memory leak is prevented. This really helped because 
you would delete[] the data in member and then make sure its a 0. Then add what you want 
to it using the data members name equal to "new" and name of new stuff. The reference of a current object like "*this" was helpful because its deferencing it as we learned in the other workshop and quiz.
